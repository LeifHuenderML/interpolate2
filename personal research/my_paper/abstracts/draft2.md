This study addresses the challenge of making accurate agricultural forecasts in microclimates using limited or noisy data. Our research focuses on the application of similarity comparison methods to analyze microclimate data streams, employing four distinct metrics: Geometric, Correlation, Information Theory, and Manifold comparisons. By analyzing ten different metrics across these methods, we identify the most insightful approaches for predicting crop yields in similar microclimates. We evaluate the effectiveness of these methods by comparing the accuracy of crop yield predictions.
Further, we explore the utility of similarity scores in enhancing the resolution of machine learning models aimed at improving predictive accuracy. Our comparative analysis includes both direct predictive models and sequential models, trained without the use of similarity scores. The results indicate that pretraining models with similarity-scored knowledge significantly enhances prediction accuracy.
Building on these findings, we propose the development of a new 'mixture of experts' model that integrates similarity-scored metrics. This model aims to provide more accurate and granular predictions for regions characterized by sparse or noisy data. Our future work will focus on refining this model and extending its applicability to broader climate and microclimate contexts.
