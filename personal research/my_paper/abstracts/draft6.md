This paper explores and introduces methodologies for enhancing the prediction accuracy of agricultural outcomes in microclimates characterized by sparse yield data. By leveraging high-dimensional temporal weather data from four distinct geographic regions in New Mexico (Otero, Sierra, Dona Ana, and Chaves), we employ advanced machine learning techniques, including similarity scoring metrics, Riemannian learning, transformer models, and others to identify regions with analogous microclimates. This approach advances over traditional methods by improving dataset resolution and prediction robustness. It also facilitates the exploration of lesser-known microclimates. We apply a range of similarity metrics, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and geometric distances, to analyze seasonal variations and identify significant correlations across microclimates. These correlations enable the extrapolation of data-rich insights to enhance forecasts in data-sparse areas, thus addressing challenges of data deficiency and enhancing agricultural productivity. Our predictive models, which incorporate these similarity metrics, demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting crop yields, particularly in regions previously limited by insufficient data. This research not only contributes to our understanding of microclimate influences on agriculture but also equips regions with the tools necessary for informed agricultural decision-making, aiming to improve the sustainability and efficiency of farming practices.
