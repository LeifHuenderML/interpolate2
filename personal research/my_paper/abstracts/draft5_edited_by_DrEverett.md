This study explores new methodologies for predicting agricultural outcomes in microclimates characterized by sparse meteorological data. Particularly, this study looks at reducing dimensionality in time series data as a preprocessing step for forecast models to generate simpler and more explainable forecast models. We utilize various ‘similarity’ metrics, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and geometric distances, (INCLUDE MORE IF YOU USED MORE) to identify relationships across different microclimate features for both locations and seasons (time and space dimensions) (IF YOU HAVE SPACE, EXPLAIN THIS A BIT MORE?). This information is leveraged as input in multiple machine learning techniques, including Riemannian learning and transformer models. The study employs high-dimensional temporal datasets from four geographic regions in New Mexico (Otero, Sierra, Dona Ana, and Chaves) as input data, with pecan crop yields as the ultimate outcome of interest. Our initial findings suggest that employing these methodologies may significantly improve the accuracy of crop yield predictions, especially in regions with limited data (ONLY INCLUDE THIS STATEMENT IF TRUE). Moving forward, we propose to refine these predictive models and explore a Mixture of Experts architecture to provide more precise and localized predictions across different agricultural regions. This research, still in its early stages, holds promise for improving forecasting practices in agriculture.
