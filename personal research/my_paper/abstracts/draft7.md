This study introduces and explores advanced methodological frameworks for enhancing the prediction of agricultural outcomes across microclimates using high-dimensional temporal weather data. Central to our approach is the application of similarity scoring techniques to identify microclimates with analogous weather patterns, thus enabling a more refined analysis of their impacts on crop yields. We utilize a suite of metrics (Geometric, Correlation, Information Theory, and Manifold comparisons) to evaluate similarity across diverse microclimate dimensions. Preliminary findings suggest a strong correlation between microclimate similarities and crop yield outcomes, laying a robust groundwork for predictive analytics. To leverage these insights, we have developed machine learning models that integrate the knowledge derived from similarity scores. These models employ various neural network architectures, including transformers and recurrent neural networks, to predict crop yields accurately. The utilization of similarity scores not only enhances the training of these models but also allows for the transfer of learned patterns to other microclimates with high similarity, thereby improving prediction accuracy in data-sparse regions. Moving forward, our research aims to refine these predictive models and explore the potential of a 'mixture of experts' model to provide tailored predictions for specific microclimates. This approach promises significant advancements in the precision of agricultural forecasting, potentially leading to optimized farming strategies and enhanced food security in variable climate conditions.
