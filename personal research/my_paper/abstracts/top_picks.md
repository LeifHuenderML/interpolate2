# Abstract

## Draft 3

This paper introduces an innovative methodology for enhancing the prediction accuracy of agricultural outcomes in microclimates characterized by sparse meteorological data. By leveraging high-dimensional temporal weather data from four distinct geographic regions in New Mexico (Otero, Sierra, Dona Ana, and Chaves) we employ advanced machine learning techniques, including similarity scoring metrics, Riemannian learning, and transformer models, to identify regions with analogous microclimates. This approach advances over traditional methods by improving dataset resolution and prediction robustness. It also facilitates the exploration of lesser-known microclimates. We apply a range of similarity metrics, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and geometric distances, to analyze seasonal variations and identify significant correlations across microclimates. These correlations enable the extrapolation of data-rich insights to enhance forecasts in data-sparse areas, thus addressing challenges of data deficiency and enhancing agricultural productivity. Our predictive models, which incorporate these similarity metrics, demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting crop yields, particularly in regions previously limited by insufficient data. Looking forward, we aim to develop a Mixture of Experts model that utilizes these insights to provide more precise and localized predictions.


## Draft 7

This study introduces and explores advanced methodological frameworks for enhancing the prediction of agricultural outcomes across microclimates using high-dimensional temporal weather data. Central to our approach is the application of similarity scoring techniques to identify microclimates with analogous weather patterns, thus enabling a more refined analysis of their impacts on crop yields. We utilize a suite of metrics (Geometric, Correlation, Information Theory, and Manifold comparisons) to evaluate similarity across diverse microclimate dimensions. Preliminary findings suggest a strong correlation between microclimate similarities and crop yield outcomes, laying a robust groundwork for predictive analytics. To leverage these insights, we have developed machine learning models that integrate the knowledge derived from similarity scores. These models employ various neural network architectures, including transformers and recurrent neural networks, to predict crop yields accurately. The utilization of similarity scores not only enhances the training of these models but also allows for the transfer of learned patterns to other microclimates with high similarity, thereby improving prediction accuracy in data-sparse regions. Moving forward, our research aims to refine these predictive models and explore the potential of a 'mixture of experts' model to provide tailored predictions for specific microclimates. This approach promises significant advancements in the precision of agricultural forecasting, potentially leading to optimized farming strategies and enhanced food security in variable climate conditions.


## Draft 5

This paper explores innovative methodologies for predicting agricultural outcomes in microclimates characterized by sparse meteorological data, employing high-dimensional temporal datasets from four geographic regions in New Mexicoâ€”Otero, Sierra, Dona Ana, and Chaves. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, including similarity scoring metrics, Riemannian learning, and transformer models, our study enhances the understanding of both well-documented and lesser-known microclimates. We utilize various similarity metrics, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and geometric distances, to identify significant correlations across these microclimates, thereby improving the resolution of our datasets and the robustness of our predictions. This process enables the extrapolation of data-rich insights to enhance forecasts in areas previously constrained by data deficiencies. Our initial findings suggest that employing these methodologies may significantly improve the accuracy of crop yield predictions, especially in regions with limited data. Moving forward, we propose to refine these predictive models and explore a Mixture of Experts architecture to provide more precise and localized predictions across different agricultural regions. This research, still in its early stages, holds promise for revolutionizing forecasting practices in agriculture, potentially improving the sustainability and efficiency of farming practices without making conclusive statements at this juncture.
