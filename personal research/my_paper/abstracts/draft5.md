This paper explores innovative methodologies for predicting agricultural outcomes in microclimates characterized by sparse meteorological data, employing high-dimensional temporal datasets from four geographic regions in New Mexicoâ€”Otero, Sierra, Dona Ana, and Chaves. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, including similarity scoring metrics, Riemannian learning, and transformer models, our study enhances the understanding of both well-documented and lesser-known microclimates. We utilize various similarity metrics, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and geometric distances, to identify significant correlations across these microclimates, thereby improving the resolution of our datasets and the robustness of our predictions. This process enables the extrapolation of data-rich insights to enhance forecasts in areas previously constrained by data deficiencies. Our initial findings suggest that employing these methodologies may significantly improve the accuracy of crop yield predictions, especially in regions with limited data. Moving forward, we propose to refine these predictive models and explore a Mixture of Experts architecture to provide more precise and localized predictions across different agricultural regions. This research, still in its early stages, holds promise for revolutionizing forecasting practices in agriculture, potentially improving the sustainability and efficiency of farming practices without making conclusive statements at this juncture.
