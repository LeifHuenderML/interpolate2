# Week 5 Research

## Morning Strategy

- Finish the abstract and get it formatted properly
- Create test data for tesing the sim scoring
- Begin testing the accuracy of the tools i developed

## Long-term Strategy

- Outcome: Comparative Climate Analysis:
  A. Analyze individual microclimate data streams to compare and calculate similarity scores.
  B. Assess combined microclimate data streams for seasonal variations comparison.
  C. Group years based on microclimate similarities to identify patterns.
  D. Develop predictive models (LSTM/transformer-based) linking climate to observed outcomes.
  E. Test models against various seasonal stages to evaluate performance.
  F. Synthesize findings to derive actionable insights.

## TODO

- create test dataset with known similarity ranges to test the different metrics with a similar range to the real world data
- build up a dataset for the predicive model
- figure out wayt to reduce dimensionality from the similarity scores
- run predictive models on unsimed data and similartiy scored data to see if there is a correlation between the similarity metrics
- check who needs to submit the abstract 
- email Dr. Everett

# Summary

- I finished the final draft of the abstract
- i wrote the beggnining framkeework for a predicive model
