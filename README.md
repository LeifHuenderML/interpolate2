## Introduction

**interoplate** is an innovative research project developed through a collaboration between Dr. Everett and Leif Huender at the University of Idaho's Computer Science Division. The project aims to analyze the characteristics and impacts of microclimates on global agricultural outcomes and malaria outbreaks. By employing high-dimensional temporal weather data, **interoplate** introduces a novel methodology that utilizes machine learning to identify regions with similar microclimates. This approach overcomes traditional limitations by enhancing the understanding of both well-known and obscure microclimates, thereby expanding the possibilities for precision agriculture and enabling more accurate predictions of agricultural yields in data-deficient regions.

### Project Objectives

- **Explore Microclimates**: Investigate the characteristics and similarities between microclimates globally.
- **Analyze Impacts**: Examine the effects of these microclimates on crop yields and malaria outbreaks.
- **Innovate Methodology**: Employ advanced machine learning techniques including similarity scoring metrics, Riemannian learning, and transformer models to improve prediction models.

### Key Innovations

- **Data Analysis**: Utilization of Kullback-Leibler divergence and Riemann manifold scoring to identify microclimate similarities and trends.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Development of transformer-based neural networks to enhance the accuracy of predicting crop yields influenced by climatic variables across various seasons and locations.

### Contributions to Agriculture

Our findings demonstrate significant improvements in prediction accuracy for agricultural outcomes, providing essential insights to farmers in regions previously considered data-deficient. This study highlights the potential of leveraging large datasets to transform farming practices and increase crop yields, particularly in underserved areas.
